--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A series of online courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). I would like to express my sincerely gratitude to Prof. [**Andrew Ng**](www.andrewng.org) from Stanford University to offer this Deep Learning course.
I took Artifical Intelligence/Machine Learning before in my master degree. What I found this course is more indepth to illustrate each algorithm formula (both forward propagation and backprop) and explain with examples very clearly.
This course require knowledge of Python,Tensorflow and some advance maths(Calculus,PDE,Matrix).

### Reminder
-------------------
I enjoy so much when doing these programming assignment. All of them are so funny and well-presented with explanation.
I put the assignment solutions as my own reference. Please dont copy and paste direct to your assignment. 
It's pretty straight-forward and hope you enjoy as well.
