Reinforcement Learning by resolving MAZE game
=============================================
What is Reinforcement Learing ?

Reinforcement Learnng is a machine learning technique by a feedback system (penalites and reward) applied on an AGENT under a predefined ENVIRONMENT. It moves through a series 
of states in order to reach a pre-defined target final state. This MAZE game is a rat (agent) which is trying to find the shortest route to get the cheese in a maze (ENVIRONMENT).
The agent is EXPERIMENTING and EXPLOITING past experiences (episodes) in order to achieve the goal. With subsequent fail trail and error (REWARDS and PENALITES), it will arrive
the solution of a problem. 

The solution will be reached if the agent finds the optimal sequence of states in which the ACCUMATED SUM OF REWARDS is maximal. In order to reach the goal, the agent 
need to encounter many penalites (negative reward. In this game, the rat in the maze get a small penality for each legal move because we want to get the cheese in the shortest 
possible path. Conversely, the shortest path to the target cheese cell is sometimes long and winding, and our agent have to endure many penalities.
